Enzyme Adapter React 16
=======

Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate,
and traverse your React Components' output.

Enzyme's API is meant to be intuitive and flexible by mimicking jQuery's API for DOM manipulation
and traversal.

This repo is to maintain the react 16 adapter up to date, in order to avoid any issue :)
